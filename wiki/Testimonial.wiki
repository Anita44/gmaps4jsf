"I had a great experience integrating GMaps4JSF into my project. It allowed us to heavily leverage Google Maps through GMaps4JSF's straightforward API... without a single line of JavaScript?! GMaps4JSF works well with modern AJAX JSF frameworks such as iceFaces? and richFaces?. You definitely can't go wrong integrating GMaps4JSF into your project!" - Brent Frederick (Software Developer)
