"I had a great experience integrating GMaps4JSF into my project. It allowed us to heavily leverage Google Maps through GMaps4JSF's straightforward API... without a single line of Javascript! GMaps4JSF works well with modern AJAX JSF frameworks such as iceFaces and richFaces. You definitely can't go wrong integrating GMaps4JSF into your project!" - Brent Frederick (Software Developer)

"GMaps4JSF provided us the best integration with our JSF frameworks (it plays nice with everything!) allowing us to develop the most innovative widget to track all the information related to an insurance policy. We were so hooked with the library that we even decided to contribute back our custom plugins" - Jose Noheda (Software Architect)
